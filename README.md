myWebsite

In this project I created my own website using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. There are 5 HTML pages namely Home, About Me, Resume, Portfolio and Contact.  

Each of this pages are inter-linked and to design them I used myWebsite.css file and added animations using myWebsite.js file. 
I also hosted this website on netlify, you can visit it on https://lokeshkumardas.netlify.app/

To submit my website to Google Search Console, I created sitemap online, you can see the myWebsite.xml file.

This project gave me a good understanding of Frontend Web-Developement.
Hope, this project helps you.

Thanks !!!
